          In August of 2022 I started my journey to tech by self learning
          JavaScript. Four months later I was accepted into Rithm School’s 34th
          Cohort. I'm very excited to learn with and become a member of the Rithm community.

          I am very mechanically inclined. I’ve always had a healthy curiosity
          of how and why things work. I took the family VCR apart when I was 8
          (there's an old fashioned sentence), and was building my own BMX bikes
          from spare parts by 10. I love working on cars, appliances, and
          electronics because they’re each a symphony of parts working to one
          end, all playing one song.

        <p>
          Prior to my foray into coding, I spent fourteen years working at
          Trader Joe’s in the San Francisco Bay Area. I did almost every job
          they had to offer: stock management and procurement, training,
          maintenance, and scheduling, just to name a few. I even bought a table
          saw and built produce displays in my last six months there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm sure you've been in a Trader Joe's on a busy Sunday. If you
          haven't, things can get pretty chaotic. (Pro tip: shop in the middle
          of the week, or, if you can, before 9am, things are a lot calmer and
          the shelves are all full) There are a lot of moving parts and all of
          them are moving at the same time. It was fast paced, physically
          demanding, and I absolutely loved it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After some time, I learned how to look at each section of the store
          individually. How to see each scheduled shift, every delivery, and all
          those seemingly menial tasks, and how they all fit into the delicate
          dance we did every day. I started to understand how each piece added
          to the smoothe functioning of the store.
        </p>

        <p>
          But eventually, the early mornings, 10 hour days, and constant
          kneeling and lifting took its toll. My body was sending me a message:
          time to find a career that offered a little more longevity to my back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, just like the grocery store, when I look at a website or use an
          app I can see how each part fits into the bigger picture. I love being
          able to look at source code and decipher what each piece is doing.
          <br />
          <br />
          I get to see a whole new symphony play.
