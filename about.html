          In August of 2022 I started my journey into tech by teaching myself
          JavaScript. Just four months later I was accepted into the 34th
          Cohort of Rithm School, and I'm thrilled to be part of their community and learn from the best.

          I've always been mechanically inclined, driven by my curiosity for how things work. As a child, I would take apart electronics and build my own BMX bikes from spare parts. I love working on cars, appliances, and electronics, seeing how every part plays a crucial role in the symphony of components working towards a common goal.

          Before diving into the world of coding, I spent 14 years working at Trader Joe's in the San Francisco Bay Area. I worked in nearly every role available, from stock management to training and scheduling, to maintenance and procurement. In my final six months there, I even built produce displays using a table saw I bought myself.

          If you've ever shopped at a busy Trader Joe's on a Sunday, you know how chaotic it can be. But amidst the hustle and bustle, I learned to see the store as a delicate dance, with every scheduled shift and delivery contributing to the smooth functioning of the store. I came to appreciate how every task, no matter how seemingly menial, played a critical role in the bigger picture.
        </p>

          Eventually, the physical demands of the job took a toll on my body, and I knew it was time to find a career with greater longevity. Now, instead of groceries, I work with coding languages. I love deciphering a website or app's code it to see a new symphony of play in harmony.
