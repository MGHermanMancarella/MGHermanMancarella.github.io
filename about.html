          I’m a professionally trained grocer, an amateur chef, and a
          recreational handyman that writes full stack, responsive, mobile first
          code. In August of 2022 I started to teach myself JavaScript and four
          months later I was accepted into Rithm School’s 34th Cohort. Come Q3
          of 2023 I hope to start my new career in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very mechanically inclined. My father was a mechanic, so maybe
          it’s in my blood. I’ve always had a curiosity of how and why things
          work the way they do. I love working on cars, appliances, and
          electronics because they’re each a symphony of parts playing one song.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to my foray into coding, I spent fourteen years working at
          Trader Joe’s in the San Francisco/ Bay Area. I did almost every job
          they had to offer: stock management and procurement, merchandising,
          maintenance, and scheduling, just to name a few. There are a lot of
          moving parts and all of them are moving at the same time, things got
          pretty chaotic at times. It was fast paced, physically demanding, and
          I absolutely loved it.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          Later in my career with Trader Joe’s, I learned to look at each part
          of the store, every detail, and how to see each of those parts fit
          into the store as a whole. I could step back and see the orchestra
          playing. God I loved that song. But eventually, the early mornings and
          10 hour days of lifting and kneeling took its toll. That’s part of
          what drove me to search for something that offered a little more
          longevity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I earned my AS from City College of San Francisco while I worked full
          time at the grocery store. In 2021 I moved on from Trader Joe’s to
          manage a warehouse for a co-packing company in Oakland, CA. I was only
          there for a year but I was lucky enough to get to work with some
          amazing robotics and automated systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our sister company built robotics. I installed a bespoke camera and
          micro-computer onto one of our batching machines. Its job was to count
          the number of items that passed it on the conveyor belt. I was
          fascinated and baffled by it. I understood the hardware, a simple
          camera and computer, but I didn’t understand how the parts worked
          together. Not knowing really bothered me, so I set out to learn how we
          tell our machines what to do.

        <p>
          Now, just like the grocery store, when I look at a website or use an
          app I can see how each part fits into the bigger picture. Learning to
          read and write code has opened a whole new world to me. It’s given me
          a new lense to see the things around me, to better understand them. I
          love being able to look at source code and decipher what each piece is
          doing – to see the symphony in action. It’s one of my life’s greatest
          pleasures.
