          In August of 2022 I started my journey to tech by self learning
          JavaScript. Four months later I was accepted into Rithm School’s 34th
          Cohort and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity.

          I am very mechanically inclined. I’ve always had a healthy curiosity
          of how and why things work. I love working on cars, appliances, and
          electronics because they’re each a symphony of parts playing one song.

          Prior to my foray into coding, I spent fourteen years working at
          Trader Joe’s in the San Francisco Bay Area. I learned to look at each
          part of the store, every detail, and how to see how those parts fit
          into the store as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, just like the grocery store, when I look at a website or use an
          app I can see how each part fits into the bigger picture. I love being
          able to look at source code and decipher what each piece is doing – to
          see the symphony in action.
