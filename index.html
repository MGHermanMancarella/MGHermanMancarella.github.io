- Some kind of navigation (a navbar at the top, for example).
In a multi-page site, this should link to the other pages;
on a single-page site, this should take the user to the different headings.
- At least three pages or sections:
    - Landing area/top area with a photo
    - About you (including a PDF of your most current resume)
    - Contact information
- Styling. You can either do this by writing CSS yourself or by using a
CSS framework, like Bootstrap. You donâ€™t need to have a complex or
extremely-polished visual design, but you do need to make things look
a bit stylized.
